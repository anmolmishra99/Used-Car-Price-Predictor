<h1 align="center"> Used Car Price Prediction ðŸš—</h1> 

In this notebook, we're going to go through machine learning project with the goal of predicting the price of car you want to sell. *see* **[LIVE WEBSITE](https://used-car-price-detector.herokuapp.com/)**

<H3>1. Problem defition</H3>
Predicting the price of car you want to sell based on other factors as well.

<H3>2. Data</H3>
The dataset we're going to be using is extracted from https://www.quikr.com and was scraped using a chrome extension called Instant Data Scraper.


<H3>3. Evaluation</H3>

The evaluation metric for this competition is the R^2 (Coefficient of determination) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which max R^2.
